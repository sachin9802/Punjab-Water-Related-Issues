# Punjab-Water-Related-Issues
With Punjab being one of India’s most agriculture-intensive states, this project investigates how excessive groundwater extraction and pollution threaten long-term sustainability. The experiment uses dynamic charts and maps to identify high-risk regions and inform decision-makers.

🎯 Objective
To analyze district-wise groundwater depletion, pollution index, and agricultural water usage in Punjab.
To visualize the data interactively using Google Charts (GeoChart, Bar, Pie, Column).
To make the information more accessible for awareness, research, and policy-making.

📁 Dataset Used
A custom CSV dataset containing:

District name
Latitude & Longitude
Groundwater Depletion (in meters per year)
Water Pollution Index (0–100 scale)
Agricultural Water Usage (%)

⚙️ Tools & Technologies
HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Google Charts (GeoChart, Bar, Pie, Column)
PapaParse (for parsing CSV in-browser)

💻 Experiment Description
The user uploads a CSV file through a browser.
Data is parsed and visualized in 4 chart types:
GeoChart: Maps districts using coordinates and depletion level.
Bar Chart: Compares groundwater depletion and pollution index.
Pie Chart: Shows agricultural water usage distribution.
Column Chart: Highlights water pollution intensity by district.

The interface is fully interactive and helps compare regional performance.

✅ Outcome
Clear, visual understanding of Punjab's water crisis at a district level.
Identification of hotspot districts with severe pollution and depletion.
Enables awareness among citizens and decision-makers for better resource management.
